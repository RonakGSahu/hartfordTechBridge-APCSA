 * Question 3.
 * Implement the {@code countEvens} method. Starter code is provided below.
 *
 * This method should return the number of even integers in a given array.
 * For example, countEvens({1, 2, 4, 5, 6}) should return 3 (2, 4, and 6).
 * 
 * Hint: Remember the modulo "%" operator! Even numbers are divisible by 2, 
 * so x is even if (x % 2) is 0!
