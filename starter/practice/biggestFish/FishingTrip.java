/* Problem 3 - Keeping the Biggest Fish at Mansfield Hollow Lake

You went fishing at Mansfield Hollow Lake.

Rules:
- you can catch up to 10 fish
- you can keep a maximum of 5 fish 
- you must release the rest

You recorded the length of each fish in an array.

Your job:
Keep the five largest fish and return their total length.

If you caught fewer than 5 fish, keep them all.

You may use Arrays.sort() for this problem.
